{"name":"Skinventor","tagline":"Executable Application","body":"### Welcome to the Skinvetor Application Site\r\nThis application is an interoperability tool developed to translate geometrical data from other applications (Rhino, Dynamo, Grasshopper) into **Autodesk Inventor**. The current version of this application can only read **XML** data translated from other applications. \r\n\r\n### Inspiration\r\nInventor is a platform heavily used in fabrication and engineering which has been known to streamline design to fabrication workflows. The capabilities of this platform has enabled increased efficiency within our workflows and while a there are many advanced tools within the modeling environment, there is a need to translate data more effectively between other platforms. This posed a challenge to devise a way of developing an interoperability tool that would bridge information from conceptual designs for further analysis and parametric modeling within Inventor.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14895906/10232570/7a86a4fe-6857-11e5-9ffe-baf5fa430ef0.png)\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14895906/10232867/27aa4d2e-6859-11e5-8dd5-29cfc67f5c64.png)\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14895906/10232870/2c324072-6859-11e5-9f75-54b602fb32bf.png)\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14895906/10232874/2f6038f8-6859-11e5-97da-f9dc8910aef7.png)\r\n\r\n### Workflows\r\nIn order to get this application to function properly, you will need to generate an **XML** file that is organized into sets of numbers by name (ex. Points A .... Points B) with x,y,z coordinates. The application will then open a session of Autodesk Inventor and generate a Part file. A prompt will then appear to select the XML file location, afterward converting the file selection prompt to a refresh prompt. The refresh prompt can then be used to regenerate any update made to the XML file. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDaniel Inocente\r\nMatthew Noe\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nCheck out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
