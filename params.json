The current version of this application can only read **XML** files exported from Grasshopper or Dynamo. \r\n\r\n### Inspiration\r\nInventor is a platform heavily used in fabrication and engineering workflows for streamlining design to fabrication. Inventor has enabled increased efficiency within our own practice and while there are many advanced tools within the modeling environment such as sheet metal design, frame authoring, parametric assembly and structural analysis tools, there is still a need to translate data more effectively between other design platforms. This posed the challenge of developing an interoperability tool that would bridge information from conceptual designs in RHino into Inventor further analysis and parametric assembly modeling.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14895906/10233991/cfa98f5c-685f-11e5-83a8-afd2eb1819b4.png)\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14895906/10232570/7a86a4fe-6857-11e5-9ffe-baf5fa430ef0.png)\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14895906/10232867/27aa4d2e-6859-11e5-8dd5-29cfc67f5c64.png)\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14895906/10232870/2c324072-6859-11e5-9f75-54b602fb32bf.png)\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14895906/10232874/2f6038f8-6859-11e5-97da-f9dc8910aef7.png)\r\n\r\n### Workflows\r\nIn order for **Skinventor** to function properly, you will need to generate an **XML** file that is organized into sets of coordinate numbers by name (ex. Points A .... Points B) with x,y,z data. The application will then launch a new part file from Autodesk Inventor and a window will prompt you to select the XML file. This window will then turn into a refresh button that allows you to regenerate any updates made to the Rhino Model and XML file. \r\n\r\n### Team\r\nDaniel Inocente & Matthew Noe\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n[http://provingground.io/tools/lunchbox/](LunchBox)\r\n[http://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview](Autodesk Inventor)\r\n\r\n### Built at [AEC Hackathon 2015](http://aec-technology-hackathon-2015.devpost.com/) - [AEC Technology Symposium 2015](http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/event/aec-technology-symposium-2015/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
